## What This Is

I wanted a dead-simple way to make AI art.  
So I built **Jay Isaac AI** — type anything, get a picture in 2 seconds.  
No sign-up. No fluff. Just works.

## What It Does

- You type: `"a robot eating pizza on mars"`
- I send it to OpenAI’s DALL·E 3
- You get the image. Instantly.
- Click to download. Done.

Works on phone, tablet, desktop.
